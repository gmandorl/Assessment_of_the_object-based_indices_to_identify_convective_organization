# Assessment of the object-based indices of convective organization

The code test 7 conditions of 9 object-based organization indices.


### How to run the code
The entire code can be run by executing `run_everything.sh`
The input dataset is supplied as positional parameter, and an associated config file with the relevant information has to be present in `./data_production/organization/`.
For example
```Bash
source run_everything.sh TOOCAN
```
execute all the code using the dataset described at './data_production/organization/config_TOOCAN.py'


### The generated dataset

A dataset can be generated by running
```Bash
cd data_production/random_data
source run.sh
```


The generated dataset can be used to perform the analysis by
```Bash
source run_everything.sh RANDOM
```
The associated config file is already 
`./data_production/organization/config_RANDOM.py`
and do not need modifications.
